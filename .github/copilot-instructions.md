# Copilot Instructions for `mcp-server`

## Project Overview

- This repository appears to be the starting point for an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.
- The codebase currently contains only a `README.md` and no source code or configuration files. No build, test, or run workflows are present yet.

## Getting Started

- There are no build or run scripts, nor any language-specific files. Before implementing features, clarify the intended tech stack and architecture with the user.
- If you are asked to scaffold, prefer modern, maintainable approaches (e.g., TypeScript for Node.js, FastAPI for Python, etc.) unless the user specifies otherwise.

## Conventions & Patterns

- No project-specific conventions or patterns are discoverable yet.
- When adding files, use clear, descriptive names and standard directory structures (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `config/`).
- Document any new conventions in this file as the project evolves.

## Integration Points

- No external dependencies or integrations are present. If you add any, document them here.

## Example Workflow (to be updated as project grows)

```sh
# Example: Initializing a Node.js project
npm init -y
npm install express
```

## Next Steps

- As you add code, update this file to reflect new workflows, conventions, and architectural decisions.
- Reference key files and directories as they are created.
